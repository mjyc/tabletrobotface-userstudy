PROFESSOR ARCHIE MAKES A BANG by Bel Richardson
Professor Archie thinks a lot. He thinks of things to make.
He thinks as he brushes his teeth. He thinks at his desk.
He even thinks in bed. Then, it clicks.
Archie makes bots that can help. The bots make toast for Archie.
Archie makes a pen that can do art by itself. What do you think of it?
Archie makes it so that his bike can run his laptop.
Archie even makes it so that cars can sail.
Archie has a lot of plans. He never stops inventing.
What would you make if you were Archie?
