RANGER FORESTER by Bel Richardson
Ranger Forester will check on the animals.
Forester sees insects. This sort of bee cannot sting.
Tweet! Forester can see soft fluff.
Hiss! A snake is looking for a rock to sit on in the sun.
The spiders need to fix the web to get insects.
Here is the kangaroo family. Forester cannot see the little kangaroo.
The little kangaroo got stuck in a trap. Forester helps.
The little roo is happy. Back to its family. Thanks Forester.
Forester keeps the trap. He is very upset. He will tell the cops.
The cops get the man that set the trap. The animals are safe.
